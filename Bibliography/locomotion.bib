   abstract = {Due to its multimodal nature virtual reality technology imposes new challenges, for example, when it comes to navigating through a virtual environment. Joystick-based controls and teleportation techniques support only limited self-motion experiences, however, other techniques such as redirected walking provide promising solutions to enable near-natural walking, while overcoming limits of the physical space. In this article, we report an experiment that analyzed the effects of the three different locomotion techniques, i. e., (i) joystick-based, (ii) teleportation, and (iii) redirected walking, on the user’s cognitive map building of an indoor virtual environment, as well as effectiveness, motion sickness, presence, and user preferences. Our results suggest that redirected walking performs best regarding the user’s ability to unconsciously acquire spatial knowledge about the virtual environment. Redirected walking and teleportation were subjectively preferred over joystick by the participants. Furthermore, we found a significant effect of an increased motion sickness for joystick-based navigation. Hence, redirected walking as well as teleportation are locomotion techniques with different benefits and drawbacks, and should be preferred.},

   abstract = {The latest technical and interaction advancements that took place in the Virtual Reality (VR) field have marked a new era, not only for VR, but also for VR locomotion. Although the latest advancements in VR locomotion have raised the interest of both researchers and users in analyzing and experiencing current VR locomotion techniques, the field of research on VR locomotion, in its new era, is still uncharted. In this work, VR locomotion is explored through a systematic literature review investigating empirical studies of VR locomotion techniques from 2014–2017. The review analyzes the VR locomotion techniques that have been studied, their interaction-related characteristics and the research topics that were addressed in these studies. Thirty-six articles were identified as relevant to the literature review, and the analysis of the articles resulted in 73 instances of 11 VR locomotion techniques, such as real-walking, walking-in-place, point and teleport, joystick-based locomotion, and more. Results showed that since the VR revival, the focus of VR locomotion research has been on VR technology and various technological aspects, overshadowing the investigation of user experience. From an interaction perspective, the majority of the utilized and studied VR locomotion techniques were found to be based on physical interaction, exploiting physical motion cues for navigation in VR environments. A significant contribution of the literature review lies in the proposed typology for VR locomotion, introducing four distinct VR locomotion types: motion-based, room scale-based, controller-based and teleportation-based locomotion.},

   abstract = {The latest technical and interaction advancements within the virtual reality (VR) field have marked a new era, not only for VR, but also for VR locomotion. In this era, well-established, prevalent VR locomotion techniques are mostly used as points of comparison for benchmarking of new VR locomotion designs. At the same time, there is the need for more exploratory, comparative studies of contemporary VR locomotion techniques, so that their distinguished interaction aspects can be documented and guide the design process of new techniques. This article presents a comparative, empirical evaluation study of contemporary and prevalent VR locomotion techniques, examining the user experience (UX) they offer. First, the prevalent VR locomotion techniques are identified based on literature, i.e., walking-in-place, controller/joystick, and teleportation. Twenty-six adults are enrolled in the study and perform a game-like task using the techniques. The study follows a mixed methods approach, utilising the System Usability Scale survey, the Game Experience Questionnaire, and a semistructured interview to assess user experiences. Results indicate that the walking-in-place technique offers the highest immersion but also presents high levels of psychophysical discomfort. Controller/joystick VR locomotion is perceived as easy-to-use due to the users' familiarity with controllers, whereas teleportation is considered to be effective due to its fast navigation, although its visual 'jumps' do break the users' sense of immersion. Based on the interviews, the users focused on the following interaction dimensions to describe their VR locomotion experiences: (i) immersion and flow, (ii) ease-of-use and mastering, (iii) competence and sense of effectiveness, and (iv) psychophysical discomfort. The study implications for VR locomotion are discussed, along with the study limitations and the future direction for research.},

The fact that (i) the proposed typology is used widely and makes a significant research impact in the field and (ii) the VR locomotion field is a considerably active research field, creates the need for this typology to be up-to-date and valid. Therefore, the present study builds on this previous work, and the typology’s consistency is investigated through a systematic literature review. Altogether, 42 articles were included in this literature review, eliciting 80 instances of 10 VR locomotion techniques. The results indicated that current typology cannot cover teleportation-based techniques enabled by motion (e.g., gestures and gazes).

Results showed that the time required to complete the navigation task decreased faster for joystick-based locomotion.

Static mapping redirection methods deform the virtual scene to fit the physical space. The challenge is to deform the virtual scene in a reasonable way, making the distortions friendly to the user’s visual perception. In this paper we propose a feature-guided path redirection method that finds and takes into account the visual features of 3D virtual scenes. In a first offline step, a collection of view-independent and view-dependent visual features of the VE are extracted and stored in a visual feature map. Then, in a second offline step, the navigation path is deformed to fit in the confines of the available physical space through a mass-spring system optimization, according to distortion sensitive factors derived from the visual feature map. Finally, a novel detail preserving rendering algorithm is employed to preserve the original visual detail as the user navigates the VE on the redirected path. We tested our method on several scenes, where our method showed a reduced VE 3D mesh distortion, when compared to the path redirection methods without feature guidance.},

With the first method, “Point–Tugging,” users reach and pull the controller trigger at a point in front of them and move in the direction of the point they “tug” with the controller. With the second method, “Arm-Cycling,” users move their arms while pulling the trigger on the hand-held controllers to translate in the yaw direction that their head is facing. We perform a search task experiment to directly compare four locomotion techniques: Joystick, Arm–Cycling, Point–Tugging, and Teleporting. In the joystick condition, a joystick is used to translate the user in the yaw direction of gaze with physical rotations matching virtual rotations. In the teleporting condition, the controllers create an arched beam that allows the user to select a point on the ground and instantly teleport to this location. We find that Arm-Cycling has advantages over the other methods and could be suitable for wide–spread use.},

While Teleportation enables navigation within very small physical spaces and without causing motion sickness symptoms, it may reduce the feeling of presence and spacial awareness. Redirected walking (RDW), in contrast, allows users to naturally walk while staying inside a finite, but still very large, physical space. We present Telewalk, a novel locomotion approach that combines curvature and translation gains known from RDW research in a perceivable way. This combination enables Telewalk to be applied even within a physical space of 3m x 3m. Utilizing the head rotation as input device enables directional changes without any physical turns to keep the user always on an optimal circular path inside the real world while freely walking inside the virtual one. In a user study we found that even though motion sickness susceptible participants reported respective symptoms, Telewalk did result in stronger feelings of presence and immersion and was seen as more natural then Teleportation.},

   abstract = {With the increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) and new devices getting available with relatively lower costs, more and more video games have been developed recently. Most of these games use first person interaction techniques since it is more natural for Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). One of the most widely used interaction technique in VR video games is locomotion that is used to move user's viewpoint in virtual environments. Locomotion is an important component of video games since it can have a strong influence on user experience. In this study, a new locomotion technique we called "Point & Teleport" is described and compared with two commonly used VR locomotion techniques of walk-in-place and joystick. In this technique, users simply point where they want to be in virtual world and they are teleported to that position. As a major advantage, it is not expected to introduce motion sickness since it does not involve any visible translational motion. In this study, two VR experiments were designed and performed to analyze the Point & Teleport technique. In the first experiment, Point & Teleport was compared with walkin-place and joystick locomotion techniques. In the second experiment, a direction component was added to the Point & Teleport technique so that the users could specify their desired orientation as well. 16 users took part in both experiments. Results indicated that Point & Teleport is a fun and user friendly locomotion method whereas the additional direction component degraded the user experience.},

First, many early VEs were proof-of-concept demonstrations (with fairly crude object representations), produced at great speed often by trial and error to sell the idea of VEs to potential user organizations. Little time or thought was given to de˜ning the development process. Second, several early VEs and development processes were commercially or militarily con˜dential and therefore publication was not an option. Third, VE games were often based on other computer games, and in any case, their developers had no scienti˜c reason to publish anything on their design and development process and may have had good commercial reasons not to; no published accounts therefore exist. The fourth category of early VEs was simple usability test prototypes, to allow ergonomists and psychologists to experiment with various aspects of the virtual experience and with factors of VE usability. Again, there would be little need for, or thought given to, the VE design process.},

However, a number of challenges remain. Virtual travel is one of the most common and universal tasks performed inside virtual environments, yet enabling users to navigate virtual environments is not a trivial challenge—especially if the user is walking. In this article, we initially provide an overview of the numerous virtual travel techniques that have been proposed prior to the commercialization of VR. Then we turn to the mode of travel that is the most difficult to facilitate, that is, walking. The challenge of providing users with natural walking experiences in VR can be divided into two separate, albeit related, challenges: (1) enabling unconstrained walking in virtual worlds that are larger than the tracked physical space and (2) providing users with appropriate multisensory stimuli in response to their interaction with the virtual environment. In regard to the first challenge, we present walking techniques falling into three general categories: repositioning systems, locomotion based on proxy gestures, and redirected walking. With respect to multimodal stimuli, we focus on how to provide three types of information: external sensory information (visual, auditory, and cutaneous), internal sensory information (vestibular and kinesthetic/proprioceptive), and efferent information. Finally, we discuss how the different categories of walking techniques compare and discuss the challenges still facing the research community.},

   abstract = {Cybersickness is a type of motion sickness that may occur during a virtual reality (VR) experience. Many studies have proposed solutions to mitigate cybersickness, while navigating a virtual environment with controllers or walking over a floor. However, reducing the levels of cybersickness while physically walking on an omnidirectional treadmill has been largely overlooked. In this article, we performed a within-subject study, where 34 novice participants underwent four visual conditions while walking in a virtual maze over an omnidirectional treadmill. In the control condition, the movement speed was reduced of the half compared to a standard navigation speed, a movement speed smoothing was added, and the user's virtual body was represented. The other three conditions changed one of the visual parameters of the control condition: in the standard speed condition, the speed reduction was not performed; for the no smoothing condition, the smoothing was not performed; and for the no avatar condition, the user's avatar was removed. Results showed that the standard speed condition was reported to induce a significant level of cybersickness compared to the control and no avatar conditions. Nevertheless, standard speed was also the condition most preferred to navigate a virtual environment. This suggests the need to find a tradeoff between the easiness to move quickly in a virtual environment and the cybersickness that can be induced. We provide a discussion of the obtained results and their implications for the design of VR experiences while users walk upon an omnidirectional treadmill.},

This paper investigates the potential that natural walking in impossible spaces provides as a viable locomotion technique in VR when compared to conventional alternatives, such as teleportation, arm-swinging and touchpad/joystick. In this context, impossible spaces are locally Euclidean orbit-manifolds - subspaces separated by portals that are individually consistent but are able to impossibly overlap in space without interacting. A quantitative user experiment was conducted with n = 25 participants, who were asked to complete a set of tasks inside four houses, in each case using a different locomotion technique to navigate. After completing all tasks for a given house, participants were then asked to complete a set of three questionnaires regarding the technique used, namely the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) and System Usability Scale (SUS). Time for task completion was also recorded. It was found that natural walking in impossible spaces significantly improves (α = 0.05) immersion (as compared to teleportation and touchpad/joystick, r > 0.7) and system usability (over touchpad/joystick and arm-swinging, r ≥ 0.38), but seems to lead to slower task completion.},

   abstract = {People are interested in traveling in an infinite virtual environment, but no standard navigation method exists yet in Virtual Reality (VR). The Walking-In-Place (WIP) technique is a navigation method that simulates movement to enable immersive travel with less simulator sickness in VR. However, attaching the sensor to the body is troublesome. A previously introduced method that performed WIP using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) helped address this problem. That method does not require placement of additional sensors on the body. That study proved, through evaluation, the acceptable performance of WIP. However, this method has limitations, including a high step-recognition rate when the user does various body motions within the tracking area. Previous works also did not evaluate WIP step recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel WIP method using position and orientation tracking, which are provided in the most PC-based VR HMDs. Our method also does not require additional sensors on the body and is more stable than the IMU-based method for non-WIP motions. We evaluated our method with nine subjects and found that the WIP step accuracy was 99.32% regardless of head tilt, and the error rate was 0% for squat motion, which is a motion prone to error. We distinguish jog-in-place as “intentional motion” and others as “unintentional motion”. This shows that our method correctly recognizes only jog-in-place. We also apply the saw-tooth function virtual velocity to our method in a mathematical way. Natural navigation is possible when the virtual velocity approach is applied to the WIP method. Our method is useful for various applications which requires jogging.},

   abstract = {Redirected walking enables the exploration of large virtual environments while requiring only a finite amount of physical space. Unfortunately, in living room sized tracked areas the effectiveness of common redirection algorithms such as Steer-to-Center is very limited. A potential solution is to increase redirection effectiveness by applying two types of perceptual manipulations (curvature and translation gains) simultaneously. This paper investigates how such combination may affect detection thresholds for curvature gain. To this end we analyze the estimation methodology and discuss selection process for a suitable estimation method. We then compare curvature detection thresholds obtained under different levels of translation gain using two different estimation methods: method of constant stimuli and Green's maximum likelihood procedure. The data from both experiments shows no evidence that curvature gain detection thresholds were affected by the presence of translation gain (with test levels spanning previously estimated interval of undetectable translation gain levels). This suggests that in practice currently used levels of translation and curvature gains can be safely applied simultaneously. Furthermore, we present some evidence that curvature detection thresholds may be lower that previously reported. Our estimates indicate that users can be redirected on a circular arc with radius of either 11.6m or 6.4m depending on the estimation method vs. the previously reported value of 22m. These results highlight that the detection threshold estimates vary significantly with the estimation method and suggest the need for further studies to define efficient and reliable estimation methodology.},

abstract = {Virtual Environments presented through head-mounted displays (HMDs) are often explored on foot. Exploration on foot is useful since the afferent and efferent cues of physical locomotion aid spatial awareness. However, the size of the virtual environment that can be explored on foot is limited to the dimensions of the tracking space of the HMD unless other strategies are used. This paper presents a system for exploring a large virtual environment on foot when the size of the physical surroundings is small by leveraging people's natural ability to spatially update. This paper presents three methods of "resetting" users when they reach the physical limits of the HMD tracking system. Resetting involves manipulating the users' location in physical space to move them out of the path of the physical obstruction while maintaining their spatial awareness of the virtual space.},

   abstract = {In Virtual Reality (VR), navigating within small physical spaces often relies on handheld controller methods such as teleportation and joystick movements. While effective, these methods diverge from natural movement. This paper introduces the development of a VR tool designed to enhance immersion by customizing virtual environments for small physical spaces. By employing non-Euclidean and impossible spaces strategies, our solution enables overlapping virtual environments to fit the user's physical constraints, allowing exploration of the space through walking. This tool can benefit different areas of application, such as virtual visits to museums, training simulations and emergency scenarios. As a use case in this paper, we address virtual apartment tours. This study demonstrates the potential for more user-centric and accessible VR solutions, contributing to delivering more meaningful experiences in daily and professional settings. To assess the viability and potential applications of our approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers. These interviews yielded insights into practical applications, identified usability challenges, and suggested strategies to enhance user experience.},

   abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining increasing importance in science, education, and entertainment. A fundamental characteristic of VR is creating presence, the experience of’being’ or’acting’, when physically situated in another place. Measuring presence is vital for VR research and development. It is typically repeatedly assessed through questionnaires completed after leaving a VR scene. Requiring participants to leave and re-enter the VR costs time and can cause disorientation. In this paper, we investigate the effect of completing presence questionnaires directly in VR. Thirty-six participants experienced two immersion levels and filled three standardized presence questionnaires in the real world or VR. We found no effect on the questionnaires’ mean scores; however, we found that the variance of those measures significantly depends on the realism of the virtual scene and if the subjects had left the VR. The results indicate that, besides reducing a study’s duration and reducing disorientation, completing questionnaires in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the variance.},

   abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has been constantly evolving since its early days, and is now a fundamental technology in different application areas. User evaluation is a crucial step in the design and development of VR systems that do respond to users' needs, as well as for identifying applications that indeed gain from the use of such technology. Yet, there is not much work reported concerning usability evaluation and validation of VR systems, when compared with the traditional desktop setup. The paper presents a user study performed, as a first step, for the evaluation of a low-cost VR system using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). That system was compared to a traditional desktop setup through an experiment that assessed user performance, when carrying out navigation tasks in a game scenario for a short period. The results show that, although users were generally satisfied with the VR system, and found the HMD interaction intuitive and natural, most performed better with the desktop setup. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

   abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) provides the possibility to study pedestrian wayfinding behaviour in multi-level buildings. Although VR has been applied increasingly to study pedestrian behaviour, it has remained unclear how different VR technology would affect behavioural outcomes in a multi-level building. The study compares the adoption of different VR technologies for pedestrian wayfinding studies, via investigating the difference in pedestrian wayfinding behaviour and user experience. Wayfinding experiments with two groups of participants were conducted using either HMD VR or Desktop VR. Pedestrian movement trajectory data were collected via the VR system and user experience data were recorded via a questionnaire. These data allow for direct comparison and detailed analysis of pedestrian behaviour and user experience between the adoption of two VR technologies. The results showed that technological differences have a significant impact on wayfinding task performance and head rotation change. However, the route choice, exit choice and user experience were overall similar between the two groups. These results provide empirical evidence supporting researchers to choose between immersive and non-immersive VR when study pedestrian wayfinding behaviour.},
